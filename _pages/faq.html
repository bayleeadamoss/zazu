    <h2 id="core-vision">What is the core vision?</h2>
    <p>A fully extensible and open source app launcher for hackers, creators and
    dabblers. It comes with sane defaults to make it useful out of the box. But
    everything can be changed to fit your needs. Don't let others tell you the
    best way to be productive, configure it to be perfect for you.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 id="compare">How do you compare to alternatives?</h2>
    <p>Zazu is the first launcher to treat plugins as first class citizens. Even
    the app finder is built as a plugin which can be replaced (if desired). This
    means plugins are designed as natural extensions of Zazu and they don't
    require a special trigger such as '/' or ','. This allows a more intuitive
    plugin API that doesn't hamper discoverability.</p>
    <p>Zazu is the only cross platform app launcher that supports Linux, Mac and
    Windows. Every build is tested on all three platforms. This helps ensure it
    works perfectly when you download it, and has a consistent experience when you switch between Operating Systems.</p>
    <p>Zazu is open source licensed under a permissive MIT license. If the
    calculator is missing an important feature, make a pull request! If you hate
    this one thing about Zazu that would totally make it better, fork it!</p>
    <p>All configuration is in a single text file. It can be backuped and
    versioned so you can have a consistent experience.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 id="platform-support">Does it work on &lt;PLATFORM&gt;?</h2>
    <p>Yes! Zazu works on Linux, Mac and Windows!</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 id="can-make-plugins">Can I make my own plugins?</h2>
    <p>Absolutely! Zazu is designed with extensibility in mind. Want something
    custom to help with your job? We have a <a
        href="/documentation/plugins/">tutorial</a> to help make your first Zazu
      plugin.</p>
    <p>Don't need a calculator, get rid of it from your config (~/.zazurc.json)
    file. Need a snappier file finder, swap out the default!</p>

    <h2 id="how-fast-is-it">How fast is it?</h2>
    <p>I have not officially benchmarked it. My friends and I use it everyday
    and it is quite snappy. If a plugin feels sluggish to you let me know, I'd
    love to help you make it faster. If you already know what the problem is,
    feel free to open a pull request, I'd love to have some help. :)</p>
