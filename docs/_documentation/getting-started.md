## Download

You can go to our [Download](/download/) page to get the latest version of Zazu
or build your own. It offers a build for popular operating systems such as Mac,
Linux and Windows.

## Run

Once you open Zazu, it'll begin to install all your plugins and present you with
a notification letting you know that your plugins have been installed. Once your
plugins are installed, you can hit the default launch shortcut `alt+space` and
see Zazu appear. You can begin to type in commands such as:

* 13 feet to inches
* screensaver
* find resume.docx

## Configure

All your configuration is in a single file, to make it easy to backup and
version. It's located in your home directory under `~/.zazurc.json` (or
`C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\.zazurc.json` for Windows). Here, you can add some new
plugins and remove ones you don't want. There is more information in our
documentation on [Personal Configuration](/documentation/configuration/).

Zazu supports running in portable mode, details are found on the [configuration page](/documentation/configuration#portableMode)
