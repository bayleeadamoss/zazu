## Configuring Zazu

Your personal configuration lives in `~/.zazurc.json`. Here is an example of the
basic usage.

~~~ json
{
  "hotkey": "alt+space",
  "theme": "tinytacoteam/dark-theme",
  "plugins": [],
  "primaryMonitor": false
}
~~~~

### Hotkey

This can be any [keyboard
accelerator](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/accelerator.md)
you can think of. We recommend using `alt+space` or `cmd+space`, but it's up
to you!

### Theme

This in the format of a relative GitHub URL. For example `tinytacoteam/dark-theme`
would translate to `https://github.com/tinytacoteam/dark-theme`.

There are a [few themes](/themes) we created that you can pick from, feel free
to fork them and make your own.

### Plugins

Plugins can be in either of two formats. The first is the short GitHub URL
format for example `tinytacoteam/dark-theme` would translate to
`https://github.com/tinytacoteam/dark-theme`.

~~~ json
{
  "plugins": [
    "tinytacoteam/calculator"
  ]
}
~~~~

The second format is an object syntax that allows you to add custom variables.
These variables will be applied differently based on which
[blocks](/documentation/blocks/) the plugin is using.

Variables *ARE* case sensitive, check with individual plugins for what variables
you can use to configure it's behavior.

~~~ json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "tinytacoteam/calculator",
      "variables": {
        "OFFSET": 10
      }
    }
  ]
}
~~~~

### Primary Monitor

This determines whether Zazu opens in the center of the primary display each 
time it is toggled. 

`true` means Zazu will open in the center of the primary display the first 
time it is toggled after launching the application. Any update to Zazu's 
screen position will be saved and Zazu will open at the new position each 
time it is toggled.

`false` means Zazu will open at the center of any screen that the cursor is
hovering over. Any updates to Zazu's position will be saved for that
particular screen but not the others. Each screen's custom Zazu position
will be used to position Zazu on that screen in subsequent toggles.

Primary Monitor is `false` by default.

### Analytics

We send anonymous usage to [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/). To opt out of
sending this anonymous data you can set `disableAnalytics` to `true` in your
configuration.

## Portable Mode {#portableMode}

If you want your configuration within your application folder for portability just
create a `portable` directory inside of it. You can copy your configuration files over
from your home directory if they already exist.
